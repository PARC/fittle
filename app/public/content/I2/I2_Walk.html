                <h3>Recommended walking guidelines </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>USDA, AHA and CDC guidelines recommend at least 30 minutes (5 days a
                        week) as the minimum standard. Walking does not have to be vigorous to
                        reduce cardiovascular risk factors. Amazingly, that even includes
                        strolling. </br> *USDA: US Department of Agriculture; AHA: American Heart Association;
                        CDC: Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention
                    </li>
                    <li>One study looked at 17,000 alumni from Harvard over 20 years. The
                        conclusion was that for walking for 30 minutes, 5 days per week could
                        reduce the risk of heart attack by 28% or more.

        <h3>Important health instructions</h3>

        <p>Do not start any exercise program if you are not sure of your medical
            condition. <i>Please see your physician if you have any questions or concerns before starting this program.</i></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure you have proper attire for the weather and a water bottle
                to prevent dehydration.
            </li>
            <li>Remember to always start your workout with a sufficient warm-up. And finish off your workout with a cool-down. You can do simple stretching exercises of the legs to warm up and cool down the leg muscles that are active during walking.
            <li>Suitable walking shoes or sneakers are mandatory.</li>
            <li>If at all possible, walk on softer surfaces, such as walking trails or
                the beach. It is less stressful on the joints, particularly if you are
                older or overweight. Eventually, it will get easier if you stick with
                the program.
            </li>
            <li>Keep in mind that your safety always comes first! Do only as much as you can tolerate without any pain or discomfort.
        </ul>

        <h4>Caution</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Do not overdo it. If you get a little faint, stop and take a break. This is not a race -- your goal is to develop a healthy exercising habit.
            <li> The prize is the improved
                feeling of wellbeing and health you will get if you complete the program
                and continue walking regularly after 4 weeks.</li>
