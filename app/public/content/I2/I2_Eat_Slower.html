Slow eating is one of the most powerful and positive    health habits that you could ever learn. If you practice this habit <b><i>consistently</i></b>,    it will help keep your healthier eating lifestyle on track. </p><div  data-role="collapsible-set">    <div  data-role="collapsible"  data-collapsed="false">        <h3>Why should I eat more slowly?</h3>        <ul>            <li>Can you remember the last time you rushed through a meal? How did                you feel afterward? </li>            <li>If you don't remember feeling anything physically, what was your                mood like? Was your mind clear and sharp or did it feel slow and                sluggish, like you were in a fog?</li>            <li>Do you remember what your food smelled or tasted or looked like?                What was the texture like? </li>            <li>Can you describe in some detail what your meal consisted of? </li>        </ul>        If you cannot honestly answer most of these questions about eating your meal in a positive        light, or the entire experience escaped you, it is time to slow down!        Eating is an activity that you should do <b><i>very consciously</i></b>.    </div>    <div  data-role="collapsible">        <h3> What are the top 3 health benefits?</h3>        <ul>            <li>Weight control and maintenance. By chewing your food longer, you                slow down the pace at which you eat and as a result, you consume                fewer calories. Many people who practice this habit <b><i>consistently                </i></b>have gained control over their weight and manage it well                over time.</li>            <li>Weight reduction through portion control. It takes the brain a full 20                minutes to 'catch-up' and 'register' that food has been consumed.                Once the brain receives the signal, hormones are released telling                you brain to turn off the hunger hormones. You've reached satiety,                the feeling of fullness. </li>            <li>Better digestion and hormone regulation. The process of digestion                is one of the most metabolically active and complex activities that                your body performs every day, several times a day. When you slow                down and chew your food thoroughly, your body can better stabilize                your blood sugar and blood pressure levels, and your hormones are                more balanced. You, in turn, experience fewer mood swings,                heartburn, bloating, and cramping.</li>        </ul>    </div>    <div  data-role="collapsible">        <h3>What can I expect at the end of this study?</h3>        <ul>            <li>If you practiced the habit with some consistency and effort, you                should discover that you are reaching satiety with less food and there                may even be food left on your plate! </li>            <li>More importantly, you will likely leave the table feeling a bit more energetic, light on your feet, and satisfied.            <li>Your digestive system will thank you by functioning at its                optimal best and serve you well throughout the rest of your life.</li>    </div>    <p> To earn you check mark for the day, try eating a snack or meal a        little longer than you normally do by following the tips you receive from PARC Coach. </p></div></body></html>
