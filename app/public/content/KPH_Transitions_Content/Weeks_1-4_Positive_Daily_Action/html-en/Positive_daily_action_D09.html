Put your utensils down        between bites and fully engage in conversation with folks.</li>      <li>Pack a small healthy meal or snack if you're traveling to avoid the        call of the "fast food sirens."</li>    </ol>    <b>Tip:</b> Try one of these strategies on your next dining out occasion and    note how the experience went for you. <i>What went well when you tried the      strategy?
