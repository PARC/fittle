What would one look like for you? Most    of us have a great deal of life stresses that we have to contend with each    and every day.<br>    <br>    Child care, aging parents, chronically ill or physically challenged family    members, and running a household puts a huge drain on your emotional,    mental, and physical health.<br>    <br>    This usually leaves most of us feeling like there is very little or no time    to take care of the person who takes care of everyone else, and that would    be <b>YOU!</b><br>    <br>    Now is a good time to think about how you could organize your life a little    better or delegate smaller tasks to others so that you are free to focus on    the bigger picture: reducing your overall stress levels. <br>        <h3>Proactive self-care strategies to reduce micro-daily stressors</h3>        <ul>          <li>Plan and prep some meals in advance, giving you a few extra            moments in the future to relax and unwind before it's time to set up for dinner</li>          <li>Purge some unhealthy food items from the kitchen to avoid            temptation. As everyone knows, if it's in the house, you will            eventually eat it</li>          <li>Ask someone else in the household to prepare a simple dish or            assist in the daily or weekly preparation of meals</li>          <li>Assign or delegate a daily 5 to 10-minute chore to someone in the            household</li>        </ul>        <p>Starting right now, make a sincere effort to delegate a little more          and let go of the notion that everything must be done perfectly and          that it must be done by you. </p>  </body></html>
