For example, you could take      a 5-minute smoke break or walk for 5 minutes. Same five minutes, two      different activities with entirely different health outcomes.</p>    <p>Even if you choose to have a cigarette at some other time or on another      break, you have effectively broken a link in the chain of an undesired      behavior, albeit a small one, but it matters. You could easily wind up      smoking one or two fewer cigarettes on any given day.</p>    At the very least, you are now walking on purpose, and with a purpose for 10    minutes on the days you skip smoking on a break. That is certainly a change    for the better and worth acknowledging. <br>  </body></html>
