It can      be motivating to remind yourself of just how successful you've been and      how far you have come as you continue on your journey towards better      health.</p>    <p><b>Tip:</b> See a medical professional for a quick check-up. Make an      appointment with your doctor or dentist to deal with any aggravating      health issues that you've been either ignoring or neglecting.<br>    </p>  </body></html>
