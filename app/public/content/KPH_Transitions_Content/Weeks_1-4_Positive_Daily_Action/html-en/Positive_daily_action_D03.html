Previous      participants in the program gave these reasons:</p>    <ul>      <li>Look and feel better </li>      <li>Be healthy for my kids </li>      <li>Live a happier and long life </li>    </ul>    <p> </p>    <p>Do any of these resonate with you? </p>    <p>Can you think of other reasons to stay positive and motivated? </p>    <p>When you are thinking about what motivates you, try to define what you      want (rather than what you don't want) because it's a lot easier to take      action when you do. For example, "look and feel better" could be further      defined as, "look and feel better"(<i>with strong bones and muscles</i>).</p>    <p>If you are a bit stuck, take a few moments and think about what could you      do right <b><i>NOW</i></b> to improve or re-focus the trajectory of your      motivation to stay on track.</p>    <p><b>Tip:</b> Starting today, put motivational reminders everywhere      possible to keep your particular motivation for change fresh and in the      forefront of your mind. </p>  </body></html>
