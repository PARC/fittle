Does yours need      sprucing up or reinforcing?</h3>    One area that we all sometimes overlook is the need for a strong and    supportive network of family and friends.<br>    <br>    What action could you take right <b>NOW</b> to make that happen?<br>    <br>    Here are a few ideas to get you started:<br>    <ul>      <li>Contact someone from your past who you've always been able to count on        or is it time to branch out and look for new champions or resources for        support?</li>      <li>Spend a few minutes brainstorming with someone in your support network        to nail down what kind of help you need.</li>      <li>Look for new ways to get the people you know and love to engage in        healthier activities involving nutrition and fitness. Maybe it's making        a healthier version of favorite foods or doing something active instead        of making food the center of attention.</li>      <li>Be patient with others, but remain persistent and focus on what you        can control (your attitude, actions, routines, environment, etc.)</li>    </ul>    <b>Tip</b> No one ever achieves success alone. We all need help and    inspiration from others, especially when the going gets tough. Never be    afraid to reach out and ask for help even if you are not quite sure what    kind of support you need.  </body></html>
