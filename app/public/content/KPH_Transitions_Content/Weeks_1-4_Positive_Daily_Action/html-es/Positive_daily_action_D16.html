When is change the most comfortable? When is it the      hardest? </p>    <p>Are you sometimes too aggressive and impatient when trying to make change      happen? Or are you slow to change or could it be that perhaps, you simply      resist change because it feels too hard? </p>    <p>Today, consider how well your mindset is serving you and if perhaps, an      adjustment to how you approach change is needed. </p>    <p>During this program, you will likely experience several forms of change,      and sometimes, there will be no change at all. It's all perfectly normal      and part of the process. </p>    <p>One way to let this whole process of change unfold a little smoother is      to move your mindset towards one that is just a bit more open and fluid. </p>    <p>Rather than fight or resist any perceived notions that you have about how      quickly change <b> should</b> occur, try yielding. Allow and accept that      change is inevitable---and it's happening whether or not you agree with      the time frame. You'll likely move towards your goals as a much saner and      happier person.</p>    <p>Interested in learning more about exactly what is mindset? </p>    <p>Check out Carol Dweck's <a href="links/D16_mindset_link.html">mindset        online</a> website.
