This little and powerful exercise      may leave you feeling just a bit more positive and peaceful at the end of      the day.</p>    <p>Certainly, everything in your life will not change overnight, but it will      give you some context for the inevitability of having to <b><i>"start          over"</i></b>, <b><i>"clean the slate,"</i></b> or <b><i>"hit the          reset button,"'</i></b> which are all necessary in your quest for      meaningful change.</p>  </body></html>
