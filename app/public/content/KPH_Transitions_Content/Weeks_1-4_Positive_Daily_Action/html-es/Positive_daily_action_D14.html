It is nothing more than a string of well-rehearsed thoughts about    something or a situation, and you are simply having an emotional reaction to    them.<br>    <br>    These types of thoughts will come and go and do not determine who you are as    a person. You don't have to allow this kind of "negative self-talk" to    derail your best efforts and cause you to lose your focus and motivation.<br>    <br>    Stay tuned. Tomorrow we discuss how you might better handle and challenge    negative self-talk.<br>  </body></html>
