In fact, the    release of endorphins, the feel-good chemicals in the brain that are mainly    released by the central nervous system, will help you to relax, calm your    nerves, and boost your spirits. It might even make focusing on those    nutrition habits a bit easier.<br>        <h3> Action Ideas</h3>        You could repeat the same action a few days in a row and say        something like,<br>        <ul>          <li> "Today and tomorrow, I will stretch for five minutes or take a            5-minute walk."</li>        </ul>        <p> Or you could do an entirely new task every day</p>        <ul>          <li> "Today I will take the stairs, and tomorrow, I will add 1/4 cup            of veggies to a particular meal."</li>        </ul>        <p> Either method you use is a step in the right direction, and you are          priming your brain for positive habit formation and change. </p>      <b><br>        Tip:</b> Daily action or physical movement is the catalyst for positive      change. Once you get going, there is nothing more motivating or inspiring      than witnessing your own body in motion. <br>      <br>  </body></html>
