"Is this strategy effective in helping me reach my      desired goals and outcomes?"</h3>    <p><i>"Have no fear of perfection – you’ll never reach it." ~Salvador Dali</i></p>    <p>Let's face it. Sometimes we just have to accept the fact that our old way      of doing things just doesn't work any longer or perhaps, it never really      worked all that well in the first place. </p>    <p>Today, think about some entrenched strategies, habits, behaviors, or      actions that you currently employ that may appear to have outlived their      usefulness. Before you make the decision to put them on the chopping      block, consider that perhaps the goal or desired outcome is too big for      your current skill set and needs further breaking down into smaller pieces.</p>        <h3>A few things to consider when deciding whether to stick with a habit          or behavior</h3>        <ol>          <li>Does your goal need to be broken down into smaller, doable chunks?            Let's say you would like to prep five or six meals for the week, but            you feel overwhelmed even thinking about it, let alone finding the            time to do it. Why not start with prepping and preparing snacks for            a few days while you are cooking a meal? That is "<i><b>one</b></i>"            small action that you can do in 5 to 15-minutes to support your            overall strategy of prepping meals or snacks in advance. You are now            a little closer to the desired outcome.</li>          <li>Maybe it's time to ditch what doesn't currently work for your            long-term goals of weight reduction. Some examples might be,            consuming too few calories, eating only once a day, exercising            harder and harder or trying an array of extreme diets that limits            certain foods. These all work in the short-term (or not); however,            they are completely unsustainable.</li>          <li>Use an outcome-based decision-making process: you decide how to            move forward based on the real-life evidence you've gathered and how            it works with all of the other previous decisions you've made thus            far.</li>        </ol>      The bottom line: Make sure that you are getting the kind of results or      outcomes that you want from your current behaviors, actions, and habits.      If not, give everything a hard look, do your own experiments to test what      you are <b><i>actually</i></b> doing and then decide if you are headed in      the right direction.<br>  </body></html>
