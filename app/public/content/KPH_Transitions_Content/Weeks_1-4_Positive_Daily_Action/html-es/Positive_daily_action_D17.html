Lasting change takes focus and      resilience, which is simply your ability to recover and move on from      mistakes or difficulties.</p>    <p>If you don't automatically view yourself as being a resilient individual,      take a few moments and think about some tough times or experiences in your      life.</p>    <p>Chances are, there are at least half-a-dozen or more occasions where you      triumphed over incredible odds, obstacles, problems, and persevered even      when you just didn't think you could go any further.</p>    <p><b>Tip: </b>Write down three major experiences in your life that you      could use as motivation and a testament to your resilience. Toss it into      your Positive Jar or post it somewhere where you can see it often.<br>    </p>  </body></html>
