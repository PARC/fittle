Change something in your environment      today.</h3>    <p>Changing something in your environment <i>(even slightly)</i> can make a      difference in how you perceive and experience daily stress.</p>    <p>Spend a few minutes identifying what are some reoccurring stressful      situations for you. It could be a place, thing, person, a group, social      situations, a particular route, or your walking patterns at work.</p>    <p>As humans, we are creatures of habit, so when we are looking to change      something in our lives, it makes sense first to take a closer look at our      daily routines and how we schedule and spend our time.</p>    <p>Observe and notice what things in your daily life might be contributing      to your stress levels. Identify any cues and triggers that you can and      then decide if it's worth a try to do things a little differently. </p>    <p>For example, could you take a different route to or from work, or run      errands in a different order? Is it possible to change some aspect of your      routine or schedule, like go to bed earlier and wake up earlier or use a      daily planner?</p>    <p>Today, commit to taking some action to change something in your      environment at home or work.</p>    <p><b>Tip:</b> De-clutter your kitchen or any room in your home where you      spend a considerable amount of time. Research suggests that a chaotic      environment may interfere with your ability to exercise self-control      causing you to snack on sweets more often than healthier options.</p>  </body></html>
