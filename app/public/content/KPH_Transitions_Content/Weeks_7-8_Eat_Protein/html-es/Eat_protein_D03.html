Add another serving of asparagus, artichoke,        or broccoli to your dish or meal. </li>      <li> Lentils and beans contain some protein as well; however, you will        need to pay particular attention to serving sizes and portions because        you could easily consume more carbs than a balanced diet would allow.</li>    </ul>  </body></html>
