If      you prefer, describe your meal and snack in some detail.</p>        <h3>Action</h3>       If you are engaging in any purposeful exercise today or tomorrow        and you don't usually fuel up before or after workouts, check out the        following guidelines<br>        <ol>          <li> Roughly follow your regular eating plan. You can eat whole foods            about 1 to 2 hours before exercising, and 1 to 2 hours after            exercising. High-quality protein is always the priority, followed by            veggies, and slow-digesting carbs.</li>          <li> Eat what's right for your nutritional needs, especially after            strength training. Bump up your protein intake for muscle retention,            recovery, and improved future performance.</li>          <li> Women should consume about 20-30 grams (palm size) of protein and            men 40-60 grams (two palm sizes).</li>          <li> If you have a hard time eating solid foods around your workouts,            at the very least, consume a protein shake with a handful of greens            (spinach is easy) or a green powder, and a small banana or a handful            of blueberries.</li>          <li>Start to pay attention to what works for you and what doesn't. If            your stomach protests, you'll know it was not the right thing to            eat.</li>        </ol>        <h3>Challenge Questions</h3>        <ul>          <li>How do you feel when you fuel up before your workouts? What about            after your workouts?</li>          <li>If you struggle with eating around workouts, what makes it            difficult? What one thing could you do today to make it just a            little bit easier to get those meals in? </li>          <li>Ask the team for suggestions or ideas, if you need help. Don't            struggle alone.</li>        </ul>  </body></html>
