Baking turkey breasts instead of grilling is      another option.</p>    <p> Beef comes in at about 21 grams, while fish scores about 16 grams for      those same 3 ounces. </p>    <p><b>HINT:</b> When grilling proteins always use plenty of fresh rosemary on      the coals to neutralize and counteract chemical compounds that are      released when cooked at high temperatures. You can also sprinkle rosemary      on top of the protein source, just make sure that it doesn't overpower or      compete with other flavors. </p>  </body></html>
