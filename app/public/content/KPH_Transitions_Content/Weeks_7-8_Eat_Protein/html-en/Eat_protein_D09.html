If you're feeling adventurous try pickled herring. </p>    <div  data-role="collapsible-set">      <div  data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed-icon="carat-r" data-expanded-icon="carat-d">        <h3>Make this quick and tasty wild pickled herring recipe</h3>        <p>Cut the herring into small pieces, drizzle with some olive oil and          onions. For a quick snack, serve any of the small wild fish on a slice          of toasted whole wheat, whole grain bread or crackers and you'll have          a pretty darn healthy snack. </p>      </div>      <p><b>Tip: </b> Protein is the ultimate fat burner. When we consume lean        protein, it signals to the liver to release stored carbs and fat for        energy. On the other hand, consuming highly processed and sugary carbs,        grains, white flours, etc., signals to the body to pump out insulin        which does the exact opposite: <b><i>store new fat and prevents the            release of carbs and fat for energy.</i></b> </p>    </div>  </body></html>
