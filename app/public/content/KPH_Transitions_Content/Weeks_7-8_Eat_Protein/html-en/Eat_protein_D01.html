For the first few      months of the program, it's likely that most of your daily intake of      protein came from sources like shakes, bars, and conveniently frozen      balanced meal replacements products like <i>Healthy Choice</i> and <i>Lean        Cuisine</i>. </p>    <div  data-role="collapsible-set">      <div  data-role="collapsible"  data-collapsed="false" data-collapsed-icon="carat-r" data-expanded-icon="carat-d">        <h3>Why the emphasis on consuming so much protein? </h3>        <p>Protein is the ultimate powerhouse food. Crucial for continued weight          reduction and long-term weight management. For the next few weeks,          this habit will focus on the following areas: </p>        <ul>          <li> High-quality proteins </li>          <li> Protein sources </li>          <li> How to include more protein in your daily meal plan </li>          <li> Challenge your current thinking about proteins and what we            traditionally consider a breakfast, lunch, and dinner meal </li>        </ul>      </div>      <div  data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed-icon="carat-r" data-expanded-icon="carat-d">        <h3> How will I manage to "fit" in protein with every single meal I eat?        </h3>        <p>Just the thought of including protein with every meal may seem like          an overwhelming prospect. It turns out that it's quite manageable when          you implement effective strategies.</p>        <p>Try not to sabotage your mindset and the habit right away. Let's          first acknowledge some thoughts that may be going through your          mind: "This will be too difficult or time-consuming figuring out          my protein options" or "How in the world am I supposed to stock and          prepare that much protein in advance?" </p>        <p>Don't worry; you will have ample time to ramp up your protein intake          needed for your body weight and weight reduction goals. With just a          bit more education, practice, and remaining open to trying new          combinations of protein-rich foods, you will be pleasantly surprised          at the number of protein options that you can choose from to create          balanced, healthy meals. </p>      </div>      <div  data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed-icon="carat-r" data-expanded-icon="carat-d">        <h3>A few pointers to help you start practicing the habit today        </h3>        <ol>          <li> Start adding a small of amount of your favorite protein to every            meal you eat. Use familiar protein sources, like hard-boiled eggs,            fish, chicken, and cottage cheese. </li>          <li> To avoid becoming overwhelmed, do not try to figure out all of            your protein sources and options in the first couple of days.</li>          <li>Consistency is the name of the game here, so explore protein            options at your own pace. With practice, you will eventually figure            out the protein needs of your body. </li>        </ol>      </div>      <div  data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed-icon="carat-r" data-expanded-icon="carat-d">        <h3>What can I expect to learn by the end of practicing this habit?</h3>        <p>At the end of two weeks, you will have a better understanding of the          importance of eating protein early in the day, often, with every meal          and how those three eating behaviors positively affect your health.</p>      </div>    </div>  </body></html>
