As you become a better      cook and slowly re-introduce healthier versions of protein into your daily      meal plan, your taste buds will adjust to new flavors and textures. </p>    <p> <b> Tip: </b> By consuming protein sources that are <b><i>lean</i></b>      and <b><i>clean</i></b> (no sauces or coatings like bread crumbs or      flour), you are likely to feel a bit lighter and more energetic, fuller on      less food, and snack less throughout the day and evening. </p>  </body></html>
