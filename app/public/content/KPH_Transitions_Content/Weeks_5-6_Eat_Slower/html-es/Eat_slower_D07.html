The slowest eater around you may be a baby,    child, adolescent, or a wise senior. Teachers appear to us in many disguises    and forms. <br>    <br>    <b>Tip:</b> One of easiest ways to slow down and increase the amount of time    that you eat meals and snacks is to book an appointment with yourself to do    some mindful eating.
