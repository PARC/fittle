You should practice this new habit with all meals, snacks,      bars, and shakes (anything that you are eating). Slow eating is one of the most powerful and positive      health habits that you could ever learn. If you practice this habit <b><i>consistently</i></b>,      it will help keep your healthier eating lifestyle on track. </p>    <div  data-role="collapsible-set">      <div  data-role="collapsible"  data-collapsed="false" data-collapsed-icon="carat-r" data-expanded-icon="carat-d" >        <h3>Why should I eat more slowly? What's the point?</h3>        <ul>          <li>Can you remember the last time you rushed through a meal? How did            you feel afterward? </li>          <li>If you don't remember feeling anything physically, what was your            mood like? Was your mind clear and sharp or did it feel slow and            sluggish, like you were in a fog?</li>          <li>Do you remember what your food smelled or tasted or looked like?            What was the texture like? </li>          <li>Can you describe in some detail what your meal consisted of? </li>        </ul>        If you cannot honestly answer most of these questions in a positive        light, or the entire experience escaped you, it is time to slow down.        Eating is not an activity that you should do unconsciously. </div>      <div  data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed-icon="carat-r" data-expanded-icon="carat-d" >        <h3> What are the top three health benefits of eating slower?</h3>        <ul>          <li>Weight control and maintenance. By chewing your food longer, you            slow down the pace at which you eat and as a result, you consume            fewer calories. Many people who practice this habit <b><i>consistently                </i></b>have gained control over their weight and manage it well            over time.</li>          <li>Weight reduction and portion control. It takes the brain a full 20            minutes to "catch-up" and "register" that food has been consumed.            Once the brain receives the signal, hormones are released telling            you brain to turn off the hunger hormones. You've reached satiety,            the feeling of fullness. </li>          <li>Better digestion and hormone regulation. The process of digestion            is one of the most metabolically active and complex activities that            your body performs every day, several times a day. When you slow            down and chew your food thoroughly, your body can better stabilize            your blood sugar and blood pressure levels, and your hormones are            more balanced. You, in turn, experience fewer mood swings,            heartburn, bloating, and cramping.</li>        </ul>      </div>      <div  data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed-icon="carat-r" data-expanded-icon="carat-d" >        <h3>How do I monitor, measure, assess or gauge slow eating?</h3>        <p>Initially, you are not required to do any measured assessment. Just          report whether or not you practiced the habit. The goal is to be          mindful of the act of eating, nothing more. If this is still a hard          concept to grasp and you need some ways to measure this new habit try          doing the following:</p>        <ul>          <li>Chew your food a few more times than you normally do</li>          <li>Take smaller bites</li>          <li>Allocate an extra 5 minutes to eat each snack/meal</li>          <li>Put your utensil down between bites</li>          <li>Chew each bite of food 15-20 times</li>          <li>Take a deep breath between bites</li>          <li>Chew each bite of food until it liquefies in your mouth</li>        </ul>      </div>      <div  data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed-icon="carat-r" data-expanded-icon="carat-d" >        <h3>Rules and strategies for Eating Slower</h3>        <ul>          <li>Give yourself at least 10 minutes to do nothing but eat mindfully            with no distractions.</li>          <li>Sit down (no standing at the stove, sink, counter, refrigerator,            etc.).</li>          <li>Take a deep breath and relax. Be grateful for the food before you.            Many people in this world are food insecure.</li>          <li>Put your utensils down between bites and do not pick them up again            until you have chewed your food completely and swallowed it.</li>          <li>Keep post-it notes with eat slower reminders anywhere you are likely to see them each day            (i.e., refrigerator, computer, desk, etc.).</li>          <li>Set your phone or computer up to send you messaging throughout the            day to remind you to eat slower.</li>          <li>Schedule time to eat meals like you would for any other            appointment or activity.</li>        </ul>      </div>      <div  data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed-icon="carat-r" data-expanded-icon="carat-d" >        <h3>What can I expect at the end of this challenge?</h3>        <p>If you practiced the habit with some consistency and effort, you          should discover that you are reaching satiety with less food and there          may even be food left on your plate! More importantly, you will likely          leave the table feeling a bit more energetic, light on your feet, and          satisfied. Your digestive system will thank you by functioning at its          optimal best and serve you well throughout the rest of your life.</p>      </div>      <p>To earn your activity completion for the day, try eating a snack or meal a        little longer than you normally do. Employ any strategy that you can        reasonably do with 90-100% certainty. </p>    </div>  </body></html>
