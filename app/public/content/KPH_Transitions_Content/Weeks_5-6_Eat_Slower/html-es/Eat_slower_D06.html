See the      quick, but an not exhaustive list of foods and their travel time in the      gut below. Of course, these times will vary depending on your unique      digestive health and physiology.</p>    <div  data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed-icon="carat-r" data-expanded-icon="carat-d" >      <h3>List of foods (liquids to solids)</h3>      <ul>        <li>Semi-liquid vegetables, salads, and whole raw, steamed or cooked          vegetables stay in the digestive system anywhere from 20 to 50          minutes.</li>        <li>Semi-liquid fruit and whole fruit, 20 to 40 minutes.</li>        <li>Starchy grains about 60 minutes.</li>        <li>Legumes and beans about 90 minutes.</li>        <li>Seeds and nuts about 2 to 3 hours.</li>        <li>Dairy 120 minutes to 5 hours.</li>        <li>Protein shakes, eggs, fish, chicken, and turkey can pass through          your system within 30 minutes to 2 hours. However, red meat (beef,          lamb, and pork) can stay in the gut for 3 to 5 hours before it is          broken down and leaves the body in two to three days. </li>      </ul>    </div>    <b>Tip:</b> Be mindful of your particular energy needs at any given time. A    thumb size of nuts and seeds is a healthy snack that can carry you over    until your next balanced meal.  </body></html>
