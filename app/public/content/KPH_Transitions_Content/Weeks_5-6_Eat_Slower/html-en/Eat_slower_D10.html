You’ll have a better chance      of reaching satiety, the feeling of fullness. Eat one-half of what you      planned to eat and then move up your next mealtime a bit when you’re      likely to have to more time. </p>    <p><b>Tip</b>: It takes the brain a full 20 minutes to register that you've      eaten something, so slow it down and let your body reach satiety.</p>  </body></html>
