You made it through two weeks of one of the most difficult    habits to master! No matter what's going on in your life or eating    circumstances, you can <b><i>always</i></b> come back to this habit. Now    that you know "how" to eat, we move on to "what" to eat.<br>    <br>    After practicing this habit for a while, you may start to experience a wave    of calmness, gratitude, and a lift in your spirits with each nourishing bite    of food. <br>    <br>    One last takeaway from this powerful habit... <br>    <br>    Your digestive health is just as important as your mental health, so treat    it with great care. Science has been telling us for some time now that our    digestive system is our "second brain." Keeping a healthy digestive system    is important for weight loss and general long-term health.<br>    <br>    Tomorrow, we switch gears a bit and begin practicing a new habit. Continue    on with the habit of eating slower to the best of your ability.<br>  </body></html>
