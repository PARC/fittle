Chew your food until it    liquefies in your mouth. Take a deep breath between each bite of food.<br>    <br>    Notice the effects of various foods on your digestive system and how it    makes you feel after you've eaten them, especially after you have practiced    eating slower. You might notice that some foods, usually the processed ones    don't taste quite as good as you remember when you slow down and properly    chew them.<br>    <br>    <b>Tip:</b> If you are having issues with too much liquid in your mouth    after chewing for several bites, try taking smaller bites. You should start    to notice that you can chew another 10-15 times with less food in your    mouth. <br>    <br>  </body></html>
