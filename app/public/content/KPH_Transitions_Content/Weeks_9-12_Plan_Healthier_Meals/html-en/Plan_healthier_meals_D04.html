Eating at least three meals a day (about 200 to 500 kcal)      is easier on the digestive system than eating one huge meal. </p>    <p>You should notice that your mood and energy levels are a bit more      stabilized throughout the day, providing your brain power with a much-      needed boost it needs to function at its optimal capacity. </p>  </body></html>
