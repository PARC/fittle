With some consistent practice, you will become so efficient with      prepping food that cooking will be a breeze. </p>        <h3>Easy how-to create your own food prep system</h3>        <p>At a minimum, here are a few things you'll need to learn how to do to          get your own system up and running: </p>        <ul>          <li> Chop up veggies for salads, omelets, frittata's, soups, and stews            or for munching on healthy snacks. </li>          <li> Precook some proteins or keep canned small wild fish in stock,            deli turkey (without the nitrates) or smoked wild salmon in your            fridge. </li>          <li> Batch cook beans, stews, and soups or create your own version of            a healthy "multi-meal" made with protein, veggies and some starchy            carbs. Freeze and enjoy them later or add them to other recipes. </li>        </ul>      <p><b>Tip: </b> Keep some organic, low-sodium, canned tomatoes, chicken,        vegetable stock, and sauces with no added sugar stocked in your pantry.        Start with any one of these as a base, toss in some chopped veggies, add        some protein and - voila! You've got a stew or soup in minutes. </p>  </body></html>
