If all you have is 15 minutes, then        that's great! That is your starting point. Your skills will only become        much more effective and efficient over time.</li>      <li>Start small and keep it simple. If you are new to cooking, or your        cooking skills need some polishing up, now is probably not the time to        try your hand at creating complicated and elaborate dishes.</li>      <li>Limit your recipes to as few common and flavorful ingredients        possible, unless of course, you really enjoy cooking and have the time.      </li>    </ul>    <b>Tip:</b> Many people have experienced “cooking burnout” within the first    week of practicing this habit due to just one poorly ill-conceived, over the    top, executed dish. Don't be one of those persons. Keep it simple.<br>    <ul>    </ul>  </body></html>
