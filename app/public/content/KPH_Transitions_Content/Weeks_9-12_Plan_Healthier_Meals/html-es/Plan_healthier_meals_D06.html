Some are      quite useful for measuring and portion control. For example, if you know      that a particular container holds a pint of food then by all means use it!    </p>    <p>Glass and ceramic are ideal for refrigerating and freezing prepped and      precooked foods. Making meals super easy to heat up in a flash and grab on      the go. </p>    <p><b>Tip</b>: If you don't already own one, consider purchasing a good      roasting pan. Try your hand at <a  href="links/D06_Roast_Any_vegetable.html">roasting        up a variety of vegetables</a>. Just add some of your favorite      seasonings, a little avocado oil for cooking at high heat, and some      low-sodium chicken or vegetable stock to prevent burning and you've got      delicious roasted veggies ready to go.</p>  </body></html>
