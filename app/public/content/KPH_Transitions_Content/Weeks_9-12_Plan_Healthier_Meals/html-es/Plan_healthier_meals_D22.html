Notice if the food on your plate      represents the colors of the rainbow or does everything appear to be the      same color and texture? </p>    <p>If you need to spruce things up a bit, a great place to start is the      farmer's market. Ask questions about unusual foods that you see or      perhaps, a specific food that piques your interest.</p>    <p><b>Tip: </b>Occasionally, take pictures of your meals and snacks.      If your meals are lackluster, think of one or two foods that are vibrant      with color. </p>  </body></html>
