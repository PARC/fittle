You can find proteins, fruits, and veggies there.</li>      <li>Avoid the middle aisles where the canned goods, frozen and processed        foods, chips, and beverages can be found.</li>      <li>Never buy anything from a display case at the front or end of an isle.</li>      <li>Never shop when you are hungry, wander around the store looking for        your next meal, or attempt to plan meals on the fly.</li>      <li>Resist the urge to purchase impulse items near, at, or around the cash        register.</li>    </ul>    <b> Tip: </b>KNOW BEFORE YOU GO! Make sure you know what you're buying when    you enter the grocery store. The longer you linger in the store, the less    likely you will walk out of the store with healthy items.  </body></html>
