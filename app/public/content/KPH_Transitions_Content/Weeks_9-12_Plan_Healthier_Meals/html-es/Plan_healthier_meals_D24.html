Head straight to      the (organic) produce section, pick-up a bag of salad mix, a tomato, a few      carrots, celery, bell peppers, fennel (almost any veggies that you like      will do), grab some fresh herbs like, cilantro and/or chives, grab a can      of wild sardines, tuna, or salmon and a lemon. </p>    <p>Pay at the register and leave. When you arrive home, wash your produce      and get choppin'! Squeeze some lemon on top, add salt and pepper - and      voila! Dinner is served!</p>    <b>HINT</b>: Remember to remain mindful and eat as slow as possible.  </body></html>
