There is currently no way to measure or determine if a            food product is any of those things.</li>          <li>Trans fat claims - Food manufacturers are not required to list            trans fat as an ingredient if it contains 0.5 grams or less per            serving and that's already over the daily limit for safe consumption            of zero!</li>          <li><i>"Whole grains"</i> - The first ingredient listed should always            be <i>whole grains </i> or <i>whole wheat flour,</i> not refined            flour. </li>          <li> <i>"Made with real fruit"</i> - Umm...not even close. There's no            requirement for a product to contain any part of the whole fruit to            make this claim. </li>        </ul>      <b> </b> If you'd like to see some pics of cleverly deceiving and      misleading popular foods making health claims, take a look at <a  href="links/D27_Misleading_Labels.html">29        Foods With Health Claims That Are Making You Sick and Fat.</a><br>      <br>      <b>Tip: </b>Calculating total calories from food products in packages and      containers: Multiply the servings per container by the calories per      serving to get a more accurate picture of how many calories you will      consume should you eat the whole thing!<br>  </body></html>
