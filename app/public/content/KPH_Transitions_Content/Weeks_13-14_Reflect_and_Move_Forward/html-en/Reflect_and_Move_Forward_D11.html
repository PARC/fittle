Be sure to consider the following questions    when sharing with your teammates:    <ol>      <li> What conditions existed or did you have to create in order for you to        master the habit? </li>      <li> What's the most important thing(s) you currently do to maintain        mastery of the habit? </li>      <li> How do you plan to continue building on the success of your current        habits and future habits? </li>      <li> Why is the mastery of this habit important to you? </li>    </ol>        <h3>Examples of improvements in desired behaviors</h3>        Continue thinking about the planning healthier meals habit. Have you        noticed any changes or improvement in the examples below?        <ul>          <li> Do you feel much more confident in your ability to plan meals on            the fly or with limited ingredients? </li>          <li> Are you a little less panicky at the mere thought of having to            whip up a compliant and delicious meal in just 15-minutes? </li>          <li> When you are considering recipes to try you no longer become            overwhelmed and moved to inaction by the sheer amount of options            available. Your immediate reaction is "how can I make it compliant,            do I have enough time, and how many ingredients will I need to            substitute or hunt down to make it"? </li>        </ul>        <p> <i>Please note that these are only suggested topics. Feel free to            discuss any habit that you'd like and share with your teammates and            why it's important to you!</i></p>  </body></html>
