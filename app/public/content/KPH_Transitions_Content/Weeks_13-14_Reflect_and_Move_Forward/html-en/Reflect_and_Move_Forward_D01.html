It's more like a two-week exercise in which you      will be asked to reflect and celebrate of all of your personal      accomplishments and unique experiences while in the program and share with      the team. By doing this, you'll create and cultivate a new vision of who      you are and be able to set realistic goals for the future with a solid      plan for moving forward. </p>    <div  data-role="collapsible-set">      <div  data-role="collapsible"  data-collapsed="false" data-collapsed-icon="carat-r" data-expanded-icon="carat-d">        <h3>Why this activity in personal reflection and team sharing is          important</h3>        <p> Research continues to show that people do much better in achieving          their goals when they team up and support each other rather than going          it alone. </p>        <p>Sharing your knowledge, expertise, and experience with your teammates          who have a mutual interest and similar goals in sustaining healthy          behaviors and habits, strengthens and reinforces your support network.</p>      </div>      <div  data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed-icon="carat-r" data-expanded-icon="carat-d">        <h3> How the activity works </h3>        <p> The primary goal of this practice is to get you to take pride in all          that you have overcome and achieved thus far and share with others.          During the next two weeks, you may learn about different ways of          viewing success, progress, and achieving goals that you never          considered. </p>        <p>We begin this practice by asking you reflect on all of the wonderful          progress that you've made since the start of the program and then share          it with the team. Team activities will focus on two areas: </p>        <ul>          <li>Sharing with the team any of the habits that you feel are still            challenging or that you did not quite master or "nail it" in the way            that you had hoped. In fact, most people find that there are some            habits or behaviors that still need considerable work or refining.            That's okay and quite normal.</li>        </ul>        <ul>          <li>Sharing and participating in team activities, which describe habits            that you have mastered and how you went about making that mastery            happen. For example, you will be asked, "What did you do to master            the habit?", "How did you do it?", and "What's your plan for building            on those successes in the future?"</li>        </ul>      </div>      <div  data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed-icon="carat-r" data-expanded-icon="carat-d">        <h3>How to report whether or not you did the activity </h3>        <p> Each day you are encouraged to share some of your thoughts, ideas, or          feelings with the team about what this whole experience has been like          for you. If there are some issues or subjects that you would prefer          not share with anyone at the moment, no problem. Journal some of your          thoughts in a note book for future reference and discuss them some          other time if you choose.</p>      </div>      <p><b><u>Special Instructions for Today:</u></b> Reflect on your time in        the program by gathering your thoughts and thinking about your successes        and experiences for the past six months. Be prepared to share with the        team tomorrow.</p>    </div>  </body></html>
