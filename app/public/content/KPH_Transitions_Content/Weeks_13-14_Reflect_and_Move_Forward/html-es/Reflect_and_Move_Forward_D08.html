Day 3<br>    </b><b> <br>    </b> Share with the team habits that you feel for whatever reason may    require a bit more work. Or perhaps, you felt as though you practiced the    habit(s) correctly, but somehow it just didn't deliver the outcome that you    had hoped.    <h3>"Subtle" yet powerful examples of successful behavior and habit          changes </h3>        <ul>          <li> When unhealthy items find their way back into your environment,            you hesitate less frequently to toss them and forget about it. </li>          <li> You now quickly look up restaurants in advance and figure out            beforehand, what you will order whenever possible. If you can't            always do that, your default meal is to order a salad and request a            "lean and clean" serving of protein or just make the best choice            that you can and eat your meal super slow and stop when you've            reached satiety.</li>          <li>You eat in your car less frequently than you used to. </li>          <li> You remember to eat a small compliant meal before attending an            event more often than not. </li>          <li> You drink more water, unsweetened teas, calorie-free beverages, or            fewer calorie added drinks.</li>        </ul>      <i>Please note that the habits presented in the examples are only        suggestions.
