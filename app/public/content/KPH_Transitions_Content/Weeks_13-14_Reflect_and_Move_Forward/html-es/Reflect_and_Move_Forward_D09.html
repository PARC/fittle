ENTONCES MUEVE ADELANTE</h1>    <h3> Mastering habits </h3>    <b> </b><b>Team Activity<br>      <br>    </b> Share with the team those habits that you have (a) either mastered, (b)    had a major break-through, or (c) saw a great improvement in the frequency    in which you practice the habit. Be sure to consider the following questions    when sharing with your teammates:    <ol>      <li> What conditions existed or did you have to create in order for you to        master the habit? </li>      <li> What is(are) the most important thing(s) you currently do to maintain        mastery of the habit? </li>      <li> How do you plan to continue building on the success of your current        habits and future habits? </li>      <li> Why is the mastery of this habit important to you? </li>    </ol>        <h3>Mastering a habit requires full alignment with your values and          priorities</h3>        <p>Mastering a good habit is only possible if it's in alignment with          your priorities. It requires focus and your full intention; otherwise,          when life gets busy you will abandon the practice. Many of us let our          preferences for avoiding things that are difficult or hard displace          our priorities for maintaining good health. Sustaining healthy          nutrition and exercise habits usually takes the biggest hits when our          priorities become jumbled or murky. </p>        <p>So, if you have managed to achieve mastery (or are well on your way) of          any habit you've been introduced to since joining the program, that is          huge! You are one step closer to realizing your health goals.</p>        <p> Consider some examples from the eating slower habit and any planned          exercise program you've been following:</p>        <ul>          <li> You eat much slower than you previously did, even when no one            else is around </li>          <li> While you may not have control over the types of foods served at            an event, you automatically slow down your pace of eating, make the            best possible choices, and eat mindfully; noticing the moment you            reach satiety. </li>          <li>You feel stronger and stand a bit taller</li>          <li>You’re even starting to notice that some muscles are taking shape,            and some are making their first appearance ever!<br>          </li>        </ul>      <p><i>Please note that these are only suggested topics. Feel free to          discuss any habit that you'd like and share with your teammates why          the habit is important to you! </i></p>      <p><b> Tip: </b> The “mastery” of a habit doesn’t imply or assume that        you do something perfectly and 100% of the time. You just demonstrate        proficiency at a given task or skill, and you do it consistently and        regularly.</p>  </body></html>
