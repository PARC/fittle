ENTONCES MUEVE ADELANTE</h1>    <h3>Repeat yesterday's Team Activity</h3>    <b>How do you measure a habit's success? Day 2<br>      <br>    </b> Share with the team habits that you feel for whatever reason may    require a bit more work. Or perhaps, you felt as though you practiced the    habit(s) correctly, but somehow it just didn't deliver the outcome that you    had hoped.        <h3>Example of a subtle yet powerful, successful habit using exercise</h3>        <p>If you've been walking since the start of the weight reduction          program, you may have routinely exercised for 30 minutes, four          times a week, and nailed negotiating various types of landscapes          (hills, sand, rocks, soft soil, etc.).</p>        <p>Chances are you reached those numbers by increasing your time and          intensity consistently. Sure there were times when maybe you couldn't          exercise at all or as hard as you would have liked, but through your          resilience and perseverance, you pushed until you were back in the          game. Now when confronted with new physical challenges you have the          patience and fortitude to remain focused, consistent and do your best          whatever the circumstances. </p>      <p><i>*Please note that the habits presented in the examples are only          suggestions. Feel free to discuss any habit that you'd like and share          with your teammates.</i></p>  </body></html>
