ENTONCES MUEVE ADELANTE</h1>    <h3>Having some self-compassion is crucial to continued success as you enter a new phase of self-experimentation.</h3>    <p>You made it! Congratulate yourself on a job well done and for bringing the locus of control closer to where it belongs... <i>with you</i>i>. </p>        <h3>Preparing for the next phase of challenges after this program</em></h3>            <p>Look forward to getting excited about strengthening your            commitment to living and being the healthiest <b><i>YOU</i></b>,            possible. Below are some ideas to keep in mind as you move forward.</p>        <ol>          <li> Quell the negative self-talk such as “I can’t do this”, to a more            helpful dialogue like, “Maybe I’m not quite ready to do this or            that, but here’s what I can do right, <b><u>now</u></b>”.</li>          <li> Focus on the right things and practice the good. That may include            any useful skills and habits you came with at the start of the            program, as well as any new ones you've acquired while in the            program. Practice the good stuff consistently and let go of those            things (outcomes) that are not under your control like, “I still            can’t rock those skinny jeans I’ve had my heart set on.” </li>          <li> Ask for help when you need it so that you stay motivated and on            track.</li>          <li> Consider starting a success jar or record your positive            achievements at the end of each day and refer to them when you feel            your motivation is waning a bit.</li>          <li> Buy a new pair of workout shoes, or some really cool workout gear.</li>        </ol>      <p>A final word: <i>Do the best that you can, be kind to yourself, and keep your efforts          focused, but light in the spirit of experimentation.</i></p>      <p>Thank you for your participation in this study.</p>  </body></html>
