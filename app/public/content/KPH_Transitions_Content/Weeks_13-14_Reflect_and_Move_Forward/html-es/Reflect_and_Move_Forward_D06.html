ENTONCES MUEVE ADELANTE</h1>    <h3>How do you measure a habit's success? Day 1</h3>    <b>Team Activity<br>      <br>    </b> Share with the team habits that you feel for whatever reason may    require a bit more work. Or perhaps, you felt as though you practiced the    habit(s) correctly, but somehow it just didn't deliver the outcome that you    had hoped.        <h3>When things don't go the way we want or expect</h3>        <p>A few days ago, we touched on some healthy indicators of progress          that aren't necessarily tied to hard, measurable outcomes like          reducing your weight by 30 pounds, your waistline by 6 inches or          running a 5K. </p>        <p>While these are admirable goals, keep in mind your body is a very          complicated system; always searching for homeostasis or          attempting to keep things balanced internally. So, if you have been          excessively depriving yourself of calories, your metabolic rate (the          rate at which you burn calories at rest) will readjust to your lower          caloric intake and burn fewer calories. Your weight loss slows or          stops altogether, and you may even (<em>gasp</em>) put on weight.<br>        </p>        <p>The moral of the story? No matter how diligent you are with diet and          exercise, the fat cells in your body will do what they were programmed          to do: hold onto fat. That's why it's important to look for other ways          to measure success and understand that many other positive things          happening to your body as a result of consistently practicing          healthier behaviors and habits. </p>  </body></html>
