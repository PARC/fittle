            PARC's Commitment To Privacy
            This website (the "Site") is operated and maintained by the Palo Alto Research Center Incorporated ("PARC"). PARC is committed to protecting your privacy online. This policy informs you of the information PARC collects through the Site and how PARC may use the information that is collected or submitted to the Site.
        <p/>

            The Information We Collect
            Through the use of web beacons, cookies, embedded links and other commonly used data-gathering tools, the Site automatically gathers certain usage information on PARC's server logs including your IP address; what web page you've last visited; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system and platform; the frequency of your visits to the Site and the pages you view and other actions you take while on the Site. If you submit information or register on the Site, PARC may ask for your name, email address, company name, mailing address, and information about your interests and preferences. Once you submit information or register you are no longer anonymous to PARC.
        <p/>

            How We Use the Information
            PARC may use this information to help customize the content that you see and to contact you. PARC may send you information, including email, unless you advise PARC during the information submission or registration process, or subsequently request, that you do not want to receive these types of correspondence from PARC.
        <p/>

            How We Share the Information
            PARC maintains the information it receives online in strict confidence; information you submit to PARC is not sold to third parties. PARC reserves the right to notify its customers about administrative matters. When required by law, PARC will share information with government entities. Although PARC does not currently anticipate a change in its corporate status, in the event of a merger or acquisition of the company or a substantial portion of its assets, PARC may disclose, transfer or sell personal information collected online to the surviving or acquiring party, respectively. PARC may share or disclose this information if PARC suspects a violation of its policies or to protect the safety of any person or entity. PARC may also share or disclose information to its service providers and suppliers that use the information solely on PARC's behalf or to its parent company and affiliates for reporting processes and marketing research. Personal information collected online will remain subject to promises made in this Privacy Policy. Any information, including personal identifiable information or content, you post to a PARC blog, forum, or message board is available to and shared with all persons accessing and viewing those social networking spaces. Such information is not confidential and shall be treated in accordance with the terms and conditions of the PARC's Terms of Use.

For the purpose of internal analysis, PARC also uses cookies to track pages visited during a single session.

            PARC's Commitment To Children's Privacy
