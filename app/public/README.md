## Implementation Notes

* Card content in app/public/content needs to be linked up to the App data structures via JSON files in app/private/content

* For example:

 * the JSON files, app/private/content/prechallenge/activitySchedulePreChallengeSet.json and
app/private/content/prechallenge/activitySchedulePreChallenge.json, specifies which days the activity
in app/private/content/prechallenge/activitiesPreChallenge.json should be scheduled;

 * and this last file defines the links to the Fittle content:
```
 "content": "content/prechallenge/prechallenge.html"
```

 * and these in turn are initially defined in the Meteor settings file, app/settings.json;

 * and the settings.json file is in turn properly set via running a script prior to deployment such as app/shell/setForSilverLocal.sh.
