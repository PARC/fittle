# Fittle Meteor Methods

This folder provides the method and helper function for defining all the Meteor Server services that are called by the Meteor Clients.

See https://guide.meteor.com/methods.html for more details on Meteor Methods.

In particular, the messages folder contains all the code that processes the JSON configuration files that define the detail operation of a Fittle Study.
See ```app/data/How to Use Fittle Admin Interface.pdf``` for an overview of these JSON structures and their use.
