# Fittle Testing Helpers

This folder provides the Meteor Test software helper code

## Repository Structure

|File |Purpose  |
|----|:----|
|`test-helpers.js` |Definitions used in test harnesses.|
|`lib` |Client helper code|
|`react` |React User Interface implementation that replaced the older Meteor Blaze UI|
|`styles` |Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) used in Client interface|
|`log.js` |Helper code for event logging|


## Implementation Notes

* When we migrated to Meteor 1.6 the test implementation used below broke and we did not migrate these tests as they
were no longer immediately necessary for the final Fittle deployments.
** You can try uncommenting the test dependencies (app/.meteor/packages) and run the following to see the breakage:
```
meteor test --driver-package practicalmeteor:mocha --port 3100 --settings settings.json
```


## Now deprecated test infrastructure
