# Possible Deprecations

There is some older parts of the code that could use some attention.

## Study data

app/lib/api/studies is probably no longer needed. Along with app/private/studyConfigurations.json, and
app/server/studyConfiguration.js./

All this should probably be moved into settings.json (and all the app/shell/*.txt settings file templates used to
generate the currently active settings.json file).
